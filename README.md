# OHLC Chart Engine

In this project we create a Dashboard based on which User would be able to analyze the sentiment of the specific stock. We can create an Analytical Server "OHLC" (Open/High/Low/Close) time series based on the ‘Stock List’.

The special features are:

- User should have the ability to search the different stocks based on the symbols and view the chart.
- Users should be able to filter the stock’s performance on specific date range(Weekly/Monthly)
- Users should be able to view the history of their searches.
- Users should have ability to switch between OHLC, Colored Bar, Vertex Line.
